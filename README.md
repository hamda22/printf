this project is our first team project and we are suppose to talk and practice and also learn more about printf(print formatted).



PRINTF() FUNCTION IN C LANGUAGE:

In C programming language, printf() function is used to print the (“character, string, float, integer, octal and hexadecimal values”) onto the output screen.
We use printf() function with %d format specifier to display the value of an integer variable.
Similarly %c is used to display character, %f for float variable, %s for string variable, %lf for double and %x for hexadecimal variable.
To generate a newline,we use “\n” in C printf() statement.
